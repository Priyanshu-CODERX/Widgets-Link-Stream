## Download

üì• **Download the latest version**: [Latest Release](https://github.com/Priyanshu-CODERX/Widgets-Link-Stream/releases/)

**File Format**: `.zip` archive containing the Widgets Link application

## Installation

### Step 1: Download
1. Click the download link above
2. Download the `.zip` file for your M-series MacBook

### Step 2: Extract and Install
1. **Extract the downloaded `.zip` file** (double-click in Downloads folder)
2. **Move `Widgets Link.app` to your Applications folder**
3. **Open Terminal** (Applications ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Terminal, or use Spotlight: ‚åò+Space, then type "Terminal")

### Step 3: Remove Quarantine Attributes
Since this is an unsigned app, macOS will block it from running. You need to remove the quarantine attributes:

</div>

*This is what you'll see when trying to run the unsigned app - macOS blocks it as "damaged"*

**Option 1: If the app is in Applications folder:**
```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "Widgets Link.app"
```

**Option 2: If the app is still in Downloads or another location:**
```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine path/to/"Widgets Link.app"
```

**Note**: Replace `path/to/` with the actual path where you extracted the app.

### Step 4: Launch the App
1. **Navigate to Applications folder** and double-click `Widgets Link.app`
2. The app should now launch without security warnings

**Important**: You only need to run the quarantine removal command once per app installation and this won't effect you mac.

## Required Permissions
